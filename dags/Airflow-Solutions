Solution 1:

Create a function to hold the state of the task

skip_count variable to start at zero 

Enter max number of continuous skips allowed

using check_previous_run_status check to check if status is skipped

increase the count each time dag is triggered and if previous state is skipped/failed

suppose dag run is success after 1-2 continous skips, reset skip_count to 0

if skip_count matches the number of allowed_skips in the db, then with the dag_id raise an alert in slack


storing the skips in a new table with the dag_id, task_id, skip_count, allowed_skips and timestamp to the db
 and performing functions only on skip_count and allowed_skips (if necessary)
